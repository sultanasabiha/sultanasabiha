            <p style="padding-bottom: 400px;padding-left: 20px; font-size: 120%; padding-right: 450px; text-align: justify;">I am a Brown girl born in the sub-urbs of Malda Town, West Bengal, India. I have completed my schooling in The St. Xaviers's School, Malda and I am currently a college student pursuing Computer Science Honours in Asutosh college, Kolkata. I was born to Md. Abul Kasem and Sabila Begum who were united by some miracle to make everything fall into existence. Everything I am today is all because of them.
            <br><br>
            My interest in computers developed when I met my computer teacher in school. He developed softwares which were used by local hospitals, clinics and schools for free. He used to actively share with us his experiences and difficulties while building the softwares. Since then my interest has grown and grown. Someday I wish to help society the same way he did.
            <br><br>
            I am a sports follower, I am an ameteur artist, I am a feminist, I am a gamer, I am an environmentalist, and a life-time student.
            Besides having an immense love towards programming, I also have a crush on singing and becoming a performer. I am a quiet introvert with the aspirations of an extrovert waiting to be born. I am years of experiences. And I will be more things yet to come.
            <br><br>
            I have always found myself as an enthusiastic seeker and learner, trying to make the most out of everything. I have also had an innate fascination towards inventive creation. And I am those things, I’m also much more. I’m more than a limited character count and a filtered photo to be found in the void of social media.
