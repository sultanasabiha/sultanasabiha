                    My interest in computers developed when I met my computer science teacher. He developed softwares which were used by local hospitals, clinics and schools. He used to actively share with us his experiences and difficulties while building the softwares. Since then my interest has grown and grown. Today I am pursuing bachelors in computer science and this is one of my first projects.

                    Although I aspire to be a Professor according to the wishes of my late father, I also find myself getting great joy in programming and might start my career as a full stack developer.
                    <br><br>
                    I am also learning to animate and soon might start producing short videos. Learning animation has become one of my favourite passtime in this lockdown.

                   I am an immense sports lover. Although the only sports I can afford to play now are badminton and other indoors games, my love to watch sports has never windled. Since childhood sports meant only Cricket and Football as it is for any other Indian, however my outlook completely changed after watching the Winter Olympics 2018 in PeongChang. My love for sports has only grown since then.<br><br>

                   I fell in love with Figure Skating after watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgenia_Medvedeva" target="_blank">Evgenia Medvedeva</a> on the ice in Ladies Single Skating in PeongChang.  Since then I have been a regular follower of the sport. It was a spectacular year for figure skating with the chief competitors burning the ice. The long programs of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aljona_Savchenko" target="_blank">Aliona Savchenko</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Massot" target="_blank">Bruno Massot</a> of Pair Skating and that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessa_Virtue" target="_blank">Tessa Virtue</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Moir" target="_blank">Scott Moir</a> of Ice Dance was enough to bring anyone to tears. Figure skating is a perfect mix of athletism with art.

                   <br><br>
                   Another sport I deeply root for is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One" target="_blank">Formula One</a>. The Netflix series <a href="https://www.netflix.com/in/title/80204890" target="_blank">"Drive to Survive"</a> introduced me to the world of racing. As dangerous as the sport is, it is the passion of the driver and years long love and support of the fans which makes this sport one of the most wellknown sports in the west.
                   <br><br>
                   Finally comes the most loved sport in India, Cricket. Watching cricket with my father is one of the memories I cherish a lot, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_at_the_Cricket_World_Cup#India_at_the_2011_World_Cup>" target="_blank">The World Cup of 2011</a> being the most memorable one. However slowly I have lost interest as the amount of money spent in this single sport in a country like ours is hard to accept. Sufficient support should be provided to other sports too which can bring more glory to the country.    
                   <br><br>
                   Some of the other sports I follow are archery, synchronized swimming, boxing, little bit of gymnastics and football.

                Since childhood I have loved sketching and this hobby of mine has taked a new turn in the form of animation. Pencil sketch is my personal favourite, however sometimes I try my hands at water colouring too. I hope to learn abstract painting some day. <br>Some of my favourite sketches are given below. </p>

                From cooking to knitting to embroidery, I enjoy every kind of creative work. Travelling, photography, binge watching tv series, movies and anime, cinematography, watching gameplays are everyday to do things which I love to do when I am free. These hobbies are the framework of my character too. The lessons I learn in trying to educate myself to new things build my foundations and I have come to appreciate every form of art. <br>
